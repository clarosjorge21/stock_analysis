## Overview of Project

### Purpose & Background
The background of this project is to help Steve down the road. As he is doing research to see which company is better for his parents to invest in we want to make sure that as he adds more information, the code would be able to run it. The more information he adds, the slower the code we currently have runs. 

The purpose of this project to be able to handle a larger amount of information in a shorter amount of time. The code we originally started with takes longer to run and when we eventually increase the amount of information it might not work or it will take a longer amount of time to run. With the newer and refactored code we should be able to run a larger amount of data along with doing it in a smaller amount of time. We are aiming to be more efficient and decrease the time. 

## Results

### 2017

As you can see from the images above, the refactored code in year 2017 ran in just 0.0625 seconds compared to the original code which ran in 0.5546875. 

### 2018

As you can see from the images above, the refactored code in year 2018 ran in just 0.0625 seconds compared to the original code which ran in 0.5585938.

We are saving about .49 seconds every time we run the information whether that's for 2017 or 2018. While this doesn't seem like a long time, when we increase the data this will make a difference.

## Summary

### Refactoring Code Pros & Cons
In my opinion, the biggest Pro when refactoring a code is the fact that we could potentially make the code more efficient and quicker. To add, we are usually just tweaking the original code and changing some thingss instead of making one from scratch. The biggest Con would be that you are taking a code that works and tweaking it. By tweaking it you could potentially make the code less efficient or refactoring it into a code that possibly won't run. Overall, I think it's important to know when to refactor a code and when not to refactor a code. 

### How do they apply to Refactoring the Original Script
The pros apply to refactoring the original script because as you saw from the times above, we did get more efficient and quicker. We used majority of the original code and just added more code instead of starting a new one from scratch. The con that would apply is the chances of it not running. Through trial and error, I had to find multiple solutions for multiple problems in the code.
